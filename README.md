# PyKeepApp

Simple Status Monitoring Software

  -> Monitoring rectifiers can by a hard labor, so we decided to develop a solution for monitoring network devices and capture values of interest.
  
  -> The App is developed in Python with pykeepass, pysnmp, ping3 and time modules.

  -> For the message server is used a Telegram Bot API.

  -> Only for Testing use.
